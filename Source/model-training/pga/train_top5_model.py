"""
PGA top-5-finish-probability model training -- a near-identical sibling
of train_top10_model.py (same golfer_features.parquet dataset, same
5-candidate classifier tournament), just a stricter threshold. top-5 is a
genuinely rarer, harder-to-predict outcome than top-10 (roughly half as
many positive rows in any given tournament), which is exactly why it's
its own dedicated target rather than a derived rethreshold of the top-10
model's own output -- a golfer top-10-likely isn't necessarily top-5-
likely by the same margin, so this gets its own trained decision
boundary, not an assumption borrowed from a different target.

Shares its Docker image with train_top10_model.py (see this directory's
own Dockerfile) -- Terraform's ecs-task-pga-train-top5-model.tf points at
that same image tag with a command override, rather than a second image
build, since the two scripts have identical dependencies.

Required environment variables:
    MODEL_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_REGION

Usage:
    python train_top5_model.py
