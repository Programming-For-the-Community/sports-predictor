"""
F1 projected-Sprint-starting-grid model training -- a continuous
regression target, the closest available "Sprint qualifying" model this
project can build. label_sprint_grid_position is a driver's real
starting grid for the Sprint race itself (see library/features/f1.py's
build_sprint_event_features docstring) -- Jolpica has no separate Sprint
Qualifying/Sprint Shootout results endpoint at all, so there is no
lap-time/pace data behind this target the
way train_qualifying_model.py's own gap-to-pole-derived features have
for the main qualifying session; this model can only learn from rolling
Sprint-specific race-day form (see sprint_features.parquet's own
feature set), not from any real practice-pace signal for that session.

Reads sprint_features.parquet (written by Source/feature-engineering/f1/
build_dataset.py) -- by far the smallest of every F1 dataset (Sprint
format only exists 2021+, and only a handful of rounds per season are
Sprint weekends even within that window), so treat a promoted model's
metrics with proportionally more skepticism than the other F1 models',
same caution PGA's own train_cup_winprob_model.py flags for its own
smallest dataset.

Required environment variables:
    MODEL_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_REGION

Usage:
    python train_sprint_grid_model.py
