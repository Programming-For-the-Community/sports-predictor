"""
F1 projected-finish-position model training -- a continuous regression
target, the basis for a predicted running order: at serving time, a
race's whole field can be ranked by this model's own predictions, lowest-
predicted-position first, the same "field finish order" role PGA's own
train_score_model.py plays for score-to-par.

label_finish_position is None for a non-classified result (dnf/dsq/dns
-- see library/normalize/f1.py's map_status) -- there's no real finishing
position to regress toward for those, so rows are filtered to a real
label before training, same discipline train_score_model.py's own
_filter_to_scored_rows uses for a withdrawn golfer's missing score.

Reads driver_features.parquet (written by Source/feature-engineering/f1/
build_dataset.py) from S3, then runs every CANDIDATES adapter as a
competing candidate against the same chronological holdout split via
library.ml.backtest.run_backtest, and promotes whichever wins on rmse.

Required environment variables:
    MODEL_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_REGION

Usage:
    python train_finish_position_model.py
