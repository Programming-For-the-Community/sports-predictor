"""
F1 podium (top-3 finish) probability model training -- a less extreme
positive-class rarity than win-probability's (3 podium spots vs. 1
winner per race), the PGA analog being train_top10_model.py/
train_top5_model.py's own "top-N finish" pattern generalized to F1's own
smaller, differently-shaped field.

Reads driver_features.parquet (written by Source/feature-engineering/f1/
build_dataset.py) from S3, then runs every CANDIDATES adapter as a
competing candidate against the same chronological holdout split via
library.ml.backtest.run_backtest, and promotes whichever wins on
log_loss -- identical mechanics to train_winprob_model.py, just a
different label.

Required environment variables:
    MODEL_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_REGION

Usage:
    python train_podium_model.py
